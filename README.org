* Daedalus specific instructions (changes from main spec):

We *will not* be using Gradescope for our labs. For this lab, for each
task (A through D) create the program files ~smaller.cpp~,
~smaller3.cpp~, ~leap.cpp~, and ~month.cpp~. Each should work as
specified in the main lab page. Add all four ~.cpp~ files to the
assignment repository, commit and push them. Do not add or push any
other files to to your repository.

Make sure to test each program to make sure it works correctly.
